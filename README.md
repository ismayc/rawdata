# rawdata
An R package providing interesting examples for use in R instead of mtcars, iris, and diamonds

# Ideas

- If you'd like to contribute ideas to this package (and help me build it), please add Issues and explain clearly why your data set is 
interesting.  Currently, I'd like to focus on data sets of social relevance to be more inclusive, but I'm open to other interesting "raw"
datasets too.
